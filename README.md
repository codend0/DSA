# DSA

Welcome to the **DSA** repository! This project is designed to provide a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems and solutions to help you master the fundamentals of competitive programming, coding interviews, and problem-solving skills.

## About the Project

The DSA repository includes:
- Implementations of common data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.).
- Algorithm explanations and implementations (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, etc.).
- Practice problems with solutions for various topics.
- Code snippets written in C++ (other languages may be added later).

This series is ideal for beginners and intermediate-level programmers who want to strengthen their DSA skills.

## Features

- **Topic-wise Segmentation**: Problems and solutions are organized based on DSA topics.
- **Clean and Readable Code**: Each solution is well-commented for better understanding.
- **Scalable**: Contributions and improvements are welcome to expand the repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
